//Creat a command line node application that takes in two parameters and outputs
//wheter they are equal or not.

//Hint: Start by simply loggin the value of each argument to console. Then use your
//usual javascript approach (recall that Node is still just JavasScript)


//Notes: Node will run this file example: node sriracha.js 12 15
// 12 and 15 are the two parameters
// the numbers two and three are the numbers for the strings in the array when you execute the line
